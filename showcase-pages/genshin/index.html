      <b>Ganyu</b> is also super pretty and seems like such a sweetie. She's
      also an archer and does an insane amount of damage, so I also really want
      her but i dont have :(( hopefully I'll get her one day! Since I'm mostly a
      free to play player, we'll see if I ever get either of these peeps haha+
